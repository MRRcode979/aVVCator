    <release version="0.5.0" date="2024-01-13">
      <description translatable="no">
        <p>Today, we have a very exciting development - Aviator has switched to an in-house custom fork of SVT-AV1 dubbed SVT-AV1-PSY!</p>
        <p>Featuring development efforts from BlueSwordM (author of the previous custom fork), myself (Gianni), and others, this change will enable us to have much more control over the encoder's development so that it aligns most effectively with Aviator's number one priority: visual quality.</p>
        <p>So far, SVT-AV1-PSY's most noteworthy feature is a variance boost patch that appreciably improves intra- and inter-frame fidelity consistency across wide range of content. Visual fidelity per bit is estimated to have increased by up to 5% with this patch, which currently isn't present in mainline SVT-AV1.</p>
        <p>Even though this patch should inevitably make it to mainline, the gains from having more direct control are already being realized as we can implement features like this flexibly at a pace we decide.</p>
        <p>Aside from that, FFmpeg has been updated to version 6.1, the SCM toggle has been replaced with a more useful Open GOP toggle, and the README has been modified to reflect some of these more recent changes with regard to SVT-AV1-PSY.</p>
        <p>Thank you for using Aviator, and happy encoding!</p>

    <release version="0.4.3" date="2023-12-12">
      <description translatable="no">
        <p>TL;DR, Aviator is much faster! Specifically, around 17-53% faster for presets 0 through 6 and 1-4% better quality for presets 7+</p>
        <p>Updated SVT-AV1 to a custom fork by BlueSwordM featuring changes from 1.8.0, including speed-ups for presets 1 through 6 that improve encoding speed by 17-53%. This fork features an adaptive quantization curve that boosts deltaq based on variance within superblocks. This is not available in mainline SVT-AV1</p>
        <p>SVT-AV1 now features NEON optimization, making encoding up to a whopping 8 times faster than before on ARM-based platforms</p>
        <p>Updated to GNOME 45 runtime</p>
        <p>Minor changes in the codebase that should make it easier to add an Open GOP toggle in the future (currently breaks keyframe placement)</p>

    <release version="0.4.2" date="2023-09-09">
      <description translatable="no">
        <p>Updated SVT-AV1 to 1.7.0, which features rebalanced presets &amp; more massive speed improvements</p>
        <p>In light of SVT-AV1's speedy development, Preset 7 is now high enough quality to be featured as Aviator's default speed preset</p>
        <p>"Copy Audio" now disables other audio options in the GUI</p>
        <p>New "Adaptive SCM" toggle (explained in tooltip)</p>
        <p>Small fixes &amp; adjustments</p>

    <release version="0.4.1" date="2023-07-06">
      <description translatable="no">
        <p>Updated SVT-AV1 fork promises up to a 40% speed improvement for higher quality presets (p5 &amp; lower)</p>
        <p>New "Crop" option for switching between cropping &amp; scaling resolution</p>
        <p>Updated SVT-AV1 parameters for an 0.3-0.8% perceptual quality improvement</p>

    <release version="0.4.0" date="2023-05-26">
      <description translatable="no">
        <p>Custom, perceptually optimized fork of SVT-AV1 featuring a bleeding edge tune that outperforms the latest release in visual quality per bit.</p>
        <p>New audio filters, Volume &amp; Normalization, available through a slider &amp; a toggle respectively on the Audio page.</p>
        <p>Prettier SVT-AV1 parameter handling in the codebase.</p>

    <release version="0.3.0" date="2023-05-10">
      <description translatable="no">
        <p>New "Copy Audio" switch that allows passing the audio through without reencoding (disables WebM output).</p>
        <p>Improved resolution scaling with automatic width/height adjustment based on one resolution input value &amp; a less aggressive default scaling algorithm (Catmull-Rom).</p>
        <p>Removed "Match Source" buttons - resolution will match source if left empty, &amp; audio won't be reencoded at an identical bitrate (this is not smart to do).</p>
        <p>Removed Opus VBR switch.</p>
        <p>Denoise toggle for film grain denoise pass.</p>
        <p>Credited Trix for their help with rAV1ator that has transferred to Aviator. Thanks, Trix!</p>
